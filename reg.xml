                <l>Which that this troubly world hath ay on honde,</l>
                <l>That othir thyng than fruyt of bittirnesse</l>
                <l>Ne yildith naght, as I can undirstonde,</l>
                <l>At Chestres In, right faste by the Stronde,</l>
                <l>As I lay in my bed upon a nyght,</l>
                <l>Thoght me byrefte of sleep the force and might. </l>
                <l>And many a day and nyght that wikkid hyne</l>
                <l>Hadde beforn vexed my poore goost</l>
                <l>So grevously that of angwissh and pyne</l>
                <l>No rycher man was nowhere in no coost.</l>
                <l>This dar I seyn, may no wight make his boost</l>
                <l>That he with thoght was bet than I aqweynted,</l>
                <l>For to the deeth he wel ny hath me feynted.</l>
                <l>Bysyly in my mynde I gan revolve</l>
                <l>The welthe unseur of every creature,</l>
                <l>How lightly that Fortune it can dissolve</l>
                <l>Whan that hir list that it no lenger dure;</l>
                <l>And of the brotilnesse of hir nature</l>
                <l>My tremblynge herte so greet gastnesse hadde</l>
                <l>That my spirites were of my lyf sadde.</l>
                <l>Me fil to mynde how that nat longe agoo</l>
                <l>Fortunes strook doun thraste estat rial</l>
                <l>Into mescheef, and I took heede also</l>
                <l>Of many anothir lord that hadde a fal.</l>
                <l>In mene estat eek sikirnesse at al</l>
                <l>Ne saw I noon, but I sy atte laste</l>
                <l>Wher seuretee for to abyde hir caste.</l>
                <l>In poore estat shee pighte hir pavyloun</l>
                <l>To kevere hir fro the storm of descendynge</l>
                <l>For shee kneew no lower descencion</l>
                <l>Sauf oonly deeth, fro which no wight lyvynge</l>
                <l>Deffende him may; and thus in my musynge</l>
                <l>I destitut was of joie and good hope,</l>
                <l>And to myn ese nothyng cowde I grope.</l>
                <l>For right as blyve ran it in my thoght,</l>
                <l>Thogh poore I be, yit sumwhat leese I may.</l>
                <l>Than deemed I that seurtee wolde noght</l>
                <l>With me abyde; it is nat to hir pay</l>
                <l>Ther to sojourne as shee descende may.</l>
                <l>And thus unsikir of my smal lyflode,</l>
                <l>Thoght leide on me ful many an hevy lode.</l>
                <l>I thoghte eek, if I into povert creepe,</l>
                <l>Than am I entred into sikirnesse;</l>
                <l>But swich seurtee mighte I ay waille and weepe,</l>
                <l>For povert breedith naght but hevynesse.</l>
                <l>Allas, wher is this worldes stablenesse?</l>
                <l>Heer up, heer doun; heer honour, heer repreef;</l>
                <l>Now hool, now seek; now bountee, now mescheef.</l>
                <l>And whan I hadde rollid up and doun</l>
                <l>This worldes stormy wawes in my mynde,</l>
                <l>I sy wel povert was exclusioun</l>
                <l>Of al welfare regnynge in mankynde;</l>
                <l>And how in bookes thus writen I fynde,</l>
                <l>"The werste kynde of wrecchidnesse is</l>
                <l>A man to han be weleful or this."</l>
                <l>Allas, thoghte I, what sikirnesse is that</l>
                <l>To lyve ay seur of greef and of nusance?</l>
                <l>What shal I do? Best is I stryve nat</l>
                <l>Ageyn the peys of Fortunes balance,</l>
                <l>For wel I woot that hir brotil constance</l>
                <l>A wight no whyle souffre can sojourne</l>
                <l>In o plyt; thus nat wiste I how to tourne.</l>
                <l>For whan man weeneth stonde moost constant,</l>
                <l>Thanne is he nexte to his overthrowynge;</l>
                <l>So flittynge is shee and so variant,</l>
                <l>Ther is no trust upon hir fair lawhynge;</l>
                <l>Aftir glad look, shee shapith hir to stynge.</l>
                <l>I was adrad so of hir gerynesse</l>
                <l>That my lyf was but a deedly gladnesse.</l>
                <l>This ilke nyght I walwid to and fro</l>
                <l>Seekynge reste, but certeynly shee</l>
                <l>Appeerid nat, for thoght, my cruel fo,</l>
                <l>Chaced had hir and sleep away fro me.</l>
                <l>And for I sholde nat allone be,</l>
                <l>Ageyn my lust wach proferred his servyse,</l>
                <l>And I admittid him in hevy wyse.</l>
                <l>So long a nyght ne felte I nevere noon</l>
                <l>As was that same, to my jugement.</l>
                <l>Whoso that thoghty is, is wo begoon;</l>
                <l>The thoghtful wight is vessel of torment;</l>
                <l>Ther nis no greef to him equipollent.</l>
                <l>He graveth deepest of seeknesses alle:</l>
                <l>Ful wo is him that in swich thoght is falle.</l>
                <l>What wight that inly pensyf is, I trowe,</l>
                <l>His moost desir is to be solitarie.</l>
                <l>That this is sooth, in my persone I knowe,</l>
                <l>For evere whyl that fretynge adversarie</l>
                <l>Myn herte made to him tributarie</l>
                <l>In sowkynge of the fressheste of my blood;</l>
                <l>To sorwe soul me thoghte it dide me good.</l>
                <l>For the nature of hevynesse is this:</l>
                <l>If it habownde greetly in a wight,</l>
                <l>The place eschueth he whereas joie is,</l>
                <l>For joie and he nat mowe accorde aright.</l>
                <l>As discordant as day is unto nyght,</l>
                <l>And honour adversarie is unto shame,</l>
                <l>Is hevynesse so to joie and game.</l>
                <l>Whan to the thoghtful wight is told a tale,</l>
                <l>He heerith it as thogh he thennes were;</l>
                <l>His hevy thoghtes him so plukke and hale</l>
                <l>Hidir and thidir, and him greeve and dere,</l>
                <l>That his eres availle him nat a pere;</l>
                <l>He undirstandith nothyng what men seye,</l>
                <l>So been his wittes fer goon hem to pleye.</l>
                <l>The smert of thoght I by experience</l>
                <l>Knowe as wel as any man dooth lyvynge.</l>
                <l>His frosty swoot and fyry hoot fervence,</l>
                <l>And troubly dremes drempt al in wakynge,</l>
                <l>My mazid heed sleeplees han of konnynge</l>
                <l>And wit despoillid, and so me bejapid</l>
                <l>That aftir deeth ful often have I gapid.</l>
                <l>Passe over; whan this stormy nyght was goon</l>
                <l>And day gan at my wyndowe in to prye,</l>

                <l>Into the feeld I dressid me in hye,</l>
                <l>And in my wo I herte-deep gan wade,</l>
                <l>As he that was bareyne of thoghtes glade.</l>
                <l>By that I walkid hadde a certeyn tyme,</l>
                <l>Were it an hour I not, or more or lesse,</l>
                <l>A poore old hoor man cam walkynge by me,</l>
                <l>And seide, "Good day, sire, and God yow blesse!"</l>
                <l>But I no word, for my seekly distresse</l>
                <l>Forbad myn eres usen hir office,</l>
                <l>For which this old man heeld me lewde and nyce,</l>
                <l>Til he took heede to my drery cheere,</l>

                <l>He stirte unto me and seide, "Sleepstow, man?</l>

                <l>Our lige lord your fadir dooth the same;</l>

                <l>Forwhy with mercy God shal qwyte hem wel,</l>
                <l>Aftir the wordes write in the Gospel.</l>
                <l>It is to leeve and deeme, if a kyng shyne</l>
                <l>In vertu, that his sone sholde sue</l>
                <l>And to his fadres maneeres enclyne</l>
                <l>And wikkid tecches and vices eschue.</l>
                <l>Thus oghte it be, this to nature is due.</l>

                <l>He moost is lyk to God, as seith Bernard,</l>
                <l>That holdith nothyng more precious</l>
                <l>Than to be mercyful. It is ful hard</l>
                <l>To lakke mercy and been unpitous.</l>
                <l>"Mercy wole I," seith our Lord glorious.</l>

                <l>And do no crueltee unto the swarm,</l>

                <l>I rede of a kyng that Pirus was named,</l>
                <l>Whan him was told how that men of Tarente</l>
                <l>Hadde at a feeste his estat diffamed,</l>
                <l>He for the same folkes blyve sente;</l>
                <l>And whan they cam, axid to what entente</l>
                <l>They of him spak so and so foule ferde;</l>
                <l>And oon of hem, as yee shul heere, answerde:</l>
                <l>"My Lord, if that the wyn nat faillid hadde,</l>
                <l>Al that we spak nere but game and play,</l>

                <l>That we thoghte have yspoken, in good fay."</l>
                <l>The kyng took up a lawghtre and wente his way</l>
                <l>And of al that he heeld hem ful excusid;</l>
                <l>He seide it was wyn that so hem accusid.</l>
                <l>Vengeance in this good lord hadde no stide;</l>
                <l>Mercy and humble disposicioun</l>

                <l>To your hynesse is ful accordant,</l>
                <l>And unto God almighty right plesant.</l>
                <l>Power withouten mercy a kyng torneth</l>
                <l>Into a tirant - waar that feendly chek;</l>
                <l>For in what man that crueltee sojourneth,</l>
                <l>Unto his soule it is an odious spek.</l>
                <l>Tho men of God han neithir look ne bek</l>
                <l>But if that it be bekkes of manace;</l>
                <l>Whereas is mercy, folwith moche grace.</l>

                <l>Ther was a duc callid Pisistaris,</l>
                <l>That a yong doghtir hadde, a fair may,</l>

                <l>A yong, fressh, lusty, wel byseyen man</l>

                <l>And as this yong man mette hire in the weye,</l>

                <l>Thus seide this duc, merciable and wys.</l>

                <l>Thus spak and blamed him in this maneere:</l>
                <l>He seide, "If oure goddes thy body smal</l>
                <l>To thy greedy desir had maad egal,</l>
                <l>Al the world hadde nat be souffissant</l>

                <l>Senek seith, the poore Diogenes</l>
                <l>Kyng Alisaundre in richesse paste,</l>
                <l>For he ne mighte, as he seith doutelees,</l>
                <l>Geve him so mochil gold ne on him caste</l>
                <l>As he refuse wolde. O, at the laste</l>

                <l>Good loos disserved is grettest richesse.</l>

                <l>Aristotle of largesse tellith this:</l>
                <l>Who vertuously large list to be,</l>
                <l>Considere first of what power he is</l>
                <l>And eek the tymes of necessitee,</l>
                <l>And as the men disserven, so be free;</l>
                <l>Geve in mesure unto the indigent</l>
                <l>And the worthy, and that is wel despent;</l>
                <l>And who dooth othirwyse in his gevynge</l>

                <l>That to him that no neede hath giftes bedith.</l>
                <l>Of verray folie also it procedith</l>
                <l>To geve the unworthy, for that cost</l>
                <l>Al misdespendid is, for it is lost.</l>
                <l>And he that despendith out of mesure</l>
                <l>Shal taaste anoon povertes bittirnesse;</l>
                <l>Fool largesse is therto a verray lure.</l>
                <l>Of him also he berith the liknesse</l>
                <l>That on himself, as the book can witnesse,</l>
                <l>Victorie geveth to his enemys;</l>
                <l>And he that so despendith is nat wys.</l>
                <l>Largesse stant nat in mochil gevynge,</l>
                <l>But it is aftir the wil and the might</l>
                <l>Of him that geveth aftir his havynge;</l>
                <l>For it may sumtyme happe that a wight</l>
                <l>Which of richesse berith nat but light</l>
                <l>Geveth but smal and yit largere is he</l>
                <l>Than he that geveth gretter quantitee.</l>
                <l>Aftir his good man may geve and despende</l>
                <l>Whereas neede is, but he that al despendith</l>
                <l>And waastith shal himselven first offende;</l>
                <l>Fool largesse alday wrecchidly endith.</l>
                <l>Many a man hir foul outrage shendith;</l>
                <l>But of largesse is good the governance;</l>
                <l>Bothe to God and man it is plesance.</l>
                <l>Evene as a mannes blood is norisshynge</l>
                <l>To his body if it corrupt nat be,</l>
                <l>So been richesses to soules feedynge</l>

                <l>Right so a man that vicious is and wrecchid,</l>
                <l>And his richesses gote hath of rapyne,</l>
                <l>And also evele as man can ymagyne,</l>

                <l>But mochil wers; good is take heede of this.</l>
                <l>He that his flessh despendith and his blood,</l>

                <l>There is largesse mesurable good.</l>
                <l>A kyng so bownde is, he moot do so neede.</l>
                <l>Service unqwit and murdre, it is no dreede,</l>

                <l>Of fool largesse wole I talke a space,</l>

                <l>He wedde leet, and there was gladnesse</l>
                <l>And revel more than I can expresse.</l>
                <l>The fadir his doghtres and hir housbondes</l>

                <l>Of his good passyngly, and they swich cheere</l>
                <l>Him made and were of so plesant maneere</l>
                <l>That he ne wiste how be bettre at ese,</l>
                <l>They cowden him so wel cherice and plese;</l>
                <l>For he as mochil hauntid in partie</l>

                <l>They heeld him up so with hir flaterie</l>
                <l>That of despenses he was outrageous,</l>
                <l>And of his good they were ay desirous.</l>
                <l>Al that they axid hadden they reedy;</l>

                <l>Of neede eek may it cured been and helid;</l>
                <l>A man may so large despenses make</l>
                <l>Til al his good be despendid and delid;</l>
                <l>And whan his purs yemptid is and shake,</l>
                <l>Thanne begynneth indigence awake,</l>
                <l>By which he cured is of the seeknesse</l>
                <l>Of prodigalitee or fool largesse.</l>
                <l>But avarice, he seith, incurable is;</l>
                <l>For ay the more a man therin procedith</l>
                <l>And wexith old, so mochil more ywis</l>
                <l>He avaricious is; in him naght breedith</l>
                <l>But thoght and wo, for ay his herte dreedith</l>
                <l>His good to leese; and more for to hepe,</l>
                <l>His thoghtes stirten heer and theer and lepe.</l>
                <l>Now if the heed of al a regioun,</l>
                <l>By whom that al governed is and gyed,</l>
                <l>Be of so seekly a condicioun</l>
                <l>That it may by no cure be maistried,</l>
                <l>Thanne is he to the werse part applied,</l>
                <l>And, as the Philosophre seith us to,</l>
                <l>The lesse wikke is fool largesse of two.</l>
                <l>The Philosophre preeveth avarice</l>
                <l>Wel werse than is prodigalitee.</l>
                <l>By thre causes he halt it gretter vice:</l>
                <l>First, he seith, it is bettre seek to be</l>
                <l>Of a seeknesse or an infirmitee</l>
                <l>Of which a man may have rekeverynge</l>
                <l>Than of swich oon as ther is noon helynge.</l>
                <l>The second cause is, prodigalitee</l>
                <l>Is more ny to vertu many del</l>
                <l>Than avarice, and why yee shul wel see.</l>
                <l>He that is liberal nat list so wel</l>
                <l>For to receyve any good or catel</l>
                <l>As geve, but what man that is fool large</l>
                <l>To take and geve, geveth he no charge.</l>
                <l>Wherfore he seith, there is no difference</l>
                <l>Twixt fool largesse and liberalitee,</l>
                <l>Sauf the fool large, of his inprudence</l>
                <l>Of his despenses is to dislavee,</l>
                <l>And geveth theras oghte nat to be;</l>
                <l>And for what cause also and for what skile</l>
                <l>He geve shal, noon heede he take wile.</l>
                <l>And syn fool large on gold settith his herte</l>
                <l>No more than the liberal, than may</l>
                <l>Fool large into liberalitee sterte</l>
                <l>Lightly now, for vertu is kynges pray;</l>
                <l>He avarice eschue moot alway</l>
                <l>By cause shee more is contrarious</l>
                <l>To vertu than the large outrageous.</l>
                <l>The thridde skile is, for a kyng is set</l>
                <l>In his reme for his peples releef,</l>
                <l>For they sholden for him fare the bet;</l>
                <l>But the streit chynche qwenchith nevere greef;</l>
                <l>His gold is nevere salve to mescheef;</l>
                <l>Oonly to gadere and keepe he him delitith;</l>
                <l>But the fool large many a man profitith.</l>
                <l>Yit vices been they grete, bothe tweyne.</l>
                <l>O worthy Prince, take on yow largesse;</l>
                <l>Dooth so, o gracious Lord, for Goddes peyne.</l>
                <l>Largesse yput is unto the liknesse</l>
                <l>Of vessels whos mowthes han greet wydnesse</l>
                <l>And hilde out hir licour habundantly;</l>
                <l>Thus seith the Philosophre treewely.</l>
                <l>And in as mochil as a welle also,</l>
                <l>At the which many folk hir watir fecche,</l>
                <l>Needith to han the larger mowth, right so</l>
                <l>The largesse of a kyng moot ferther strecche,</l>
                <l>If he of his estat anythyng recche,</l>
                <l>Than othir mennes, for hir inpotence</l>
                <l>Strecchith nat so fer as his influence.</l>
                <l>Largesse is liberalitee ycallid,</l>
                <l>And likned is unto hem that been free;</l>
                <l>But he that avaricious is, is thrallid</l>
                <l>To moneie. A kyng moot algates flee</l>
                <l>A chynches herte for his honestee</l>
                <l>And for the profyt, as I seide above,</l>
                <l>Of his peple if he thynke wynne hir love.</l>
                <l>Victorie and honour he shal him purchace</l>
                <l>That is of giftes free, but waar alway</l>
                <l>That he nat tarie ne delaye his grace;</l>
                <l>Dryve it nat foorth unto anothir day,</l>
                <l>Whan, if him list, anoon he geve may;</l>
                <l>Geve it as blyve, his thank is wel the more:</l>
                <l>This vouche I on Holy Scriptures lore.</l>
                <l>The vertu is of liberalitee</l>
                <l>Geve and despende in place and tyme due.</l>
                <l>Right as largesse dooth in swich degree,</l>
                <l>They bothe moot in hir conceites chue</l>

                <l>What they geven, geve it vertuously.</l>
                <l>But it nat longith to the liberal</l>

                <l>Obeyynge it - al swich pees is haynous,</l>
                <l>For it is to good pees contrarious.</l>
                <l>Right swich a pees Adam hadde with Eeve</l>
                <l>Whan that he unto hir desir obeide;</l>
                <l>He was par cas adrad hir for to greeve,</l>
                <l>Wherfore he dide as that shee him seide.</l>
                <l>In that obedience he foleide,</l>
                <l>For God hire him bytook him to obeye;</l>
                <l>But I adrad am that I thus fer seye.</l>
                <l>If that this come unto the audience</l>
                <l>Of wommen, I am seur I shal be shent;</l>
                <l>For that I touche of swich obedience,</l>
                <l>Many a browe shal on me be bent;</l>
                <l>They wolen wayte been equipollent,</l>

                <l>Whan that I me bethoght have al aboute,</l>
                <l>Thogh that wommen desyre sovereyntee,</l>
                <l>And hire housbondes make to hem loute.</l>
                <l>They maad were of a ribbe, it is no doute,</l>
                <l>Which more strong is and substancial</l>
                <l>Than slyme of eerthe, and clenner therwithal.</l>
                <l>Wherfore it seemeth that the worthynesse</l>
                <l>Of wommen passith mennes, in certeyn;</l>

                <l>That also crookid is hir courtesie;</l>
                <l>But ageyn that, strongly wole I replie.</l>
                <l>For in the wrytyng and in the scripture</l>
                <l>Of philosophres, men may see and rede,</l>
                <l>Cerclely shap is moost parfyt figure,</l>

                <l>Of this helpith no contradiccioun,</l>
                <l>For it is sooth; it is no ficcioun.</l>
                <l>Every parfyt body that man can nevene</l>
                <l>Is rownd and crookid and nat streight ne evene.</l>
                <l>Begynne first at hevene and rownd it is;</l>

                <l>So biddith pees, and that to folwe I meene.</l>
